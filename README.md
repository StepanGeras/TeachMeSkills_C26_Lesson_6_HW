Lesson 6

Task 1
Create a CreditCard class with the fields account number and current amount in the account.
Create one constructor with two parameters.
Add a method that allows you to charge the amount to your credit card. The method takes an amount as input and adds this amount to the current one.
Consider how you should set the method's input and output parameters.
Add a method that allows you to withdraw a certain amount from the card. The method takes an amount as input and subtracts this amount from the current one.
Consider how you should set the method's input and output parameters.
Add a method that displays current card information.
Write a program that creates three objects of the CreditCard class that are given an account number and an initial amount.
Test script for verification:
Place money on the first two cards and withdraw from the third.
Display the current status of all three cards.
